Overview
========

Dax is an experimental framework for developing WebGL-enabled applications using Dart.
It is shamelessly ripped off [Jax](https://github.com/sinisterchipmunk/jax), hence the name.

It has very few features at this point, and most of them were obtained by
randomly typing on a keyboard until something happened on-screen.

I have very basic needs, and I will only implement what I need.
Hopefully, these needs will grow with time, and so will the features of dax.


RoadMap
=======

The initial objective of dax is to provide enough features
to make a simple game like [Cyx](http://antoine.goutenoir.com/games/cyx/).


Not implemented
===============

Features you'd expect but have not been implemented.

(pick one, hack one)

- Shader preprocessor `shared` variables
- Camera's Octree
- Lights
  - AmbientLight
  - SpotLight (extends SpatialSceneNode)
- more Meshes
- more Shaders
