Overview
========

Dax is an experimental framework for developing WebGL-enabled applications using Dart.
It is shamelessly ripped off [Jax](https://github.com/sinisterchipmunk/jax), hence the name.

It has very few features at this point, and most of them were obtained by
randomly typing on a keyboard until something happened on-screen.

I have very basic needs, and I will only implement what I need.
Hopefully, these needs will grow with time, and so will the features of dax.


RoadMap
